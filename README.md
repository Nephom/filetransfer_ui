# File Transfer UI System

A comprehensive file transfer system with modern UI and robust backend functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend File System Abstraction
- Unified interface for file operations across different storage backends
- Support for local file system with plans for cloud integration
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Proper error handling and validation for file operations

### 2. Authentication System
- User registration and login functionality
- Secure password handling with bcrypt hashing
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control
- Session timeout and security features

### 3. Real-time Progress Tracking
- Transfer progress monitoring during file operations
- Real-time status updates for long-running operations
- Progress persistence for interrupted transfers
- Integration with frontend display components

### 4. Futuristic UI Components
- Modern, sleek design with glass-morphism effects
- Responsive file browser with grid/list views
- Intuitive drag-and-drop upload interface
- Progress tracking visualization components

### 5. Drag-and-Drop Upload Functionality
- HTML5 Drag and Drop API implementation
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- File validation and error handling
- Integration with backend file upload endpoints

### 6. File Operations
- Core operations: rename, move, delete, copy/paste
- Proper error handling and validation
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Batch operation support where applicable

   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration is handled through:
- Environment variables (highest priority)
- JSON configuration files
- Default values for all settings

## Testing

All components include unit tests:
- File system abstraction
- Authentication system
- Transfer progress tracking
- Upload functionality
- File operations

Tests are located in the `/test` directory and can be run with:
```bash
npm test
```
