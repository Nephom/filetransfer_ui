## Summary

Implement drag-and-drop upload functionality for files and folders with visual feedback and progress tracking during uploads.

## Task Breakdown

### Core Drag-and-Drop Implementation
- Create drag-and-drop zone with visual indicators for file drops
- Implement HTML5 Drag and Drop API for file handling
- Add support for both single files and folder uploads (if supported by browser)
- Implement proper file validation and filtering during drag operations

### Visual Feedback and User Experience
- Design intuitive drop zones with clear visual cues
- Create hover states and drag feedback for better UX
- Implement file type validation with appropriate error messages
- Add progress indicators during upload process

### Backend Integration
- Connect drag-and-drop functionality to backend file upload endpoints
- Implement real-time progress tracking for uploads
- Handle file conflicts and naming collisions appropriately
- Add support for resumable uploads for large files

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can drag files from their local system to the upload area
- Visual feedback is provided during drag operations and file drops
- Files are properly validated before upload
- Upload progress is tracked and displayed in real-time
- Error handling is implemented for common issues (file size limits, unsupported formats)
