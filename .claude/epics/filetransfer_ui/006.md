## Summary

Implement core file operation functionalities including rename, move, delete, and copy/paste operations with proper error handling and user feedback.

## Task Breakdown

### File Operation Implementations
- Create rename functionality with validation and conflict resolution
- Implement move operations between folders with proper path handling
- Develop delete functionality with confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Add copy/paste operations with support for both files and folders

### Error Handling and Validation
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all file operations
- Add validation for file paths, permissions, and existing files
- Create appropriate error messages for different failure scenarios
- Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate

### User Experience Features
- Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations (delete, move)
- Implement undo functionality for recent file operations
- Provide clear success and failure feedback to users
- Add loading states during long-running operations

### Backend Integration
- Connect file operation endpoints to the backend file system abstraction
- Ensure all operations are properly authenticated and authorized
- Implement proper logging for audit trails of file operations
- Add support for batch operations where applicable

## Acceptance Criteria

- All file operations (rename, move, delete, copy/paste) work correctly
- Operations provide appropriate user feedback and confirmation
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- All operations are properly secured and authenticated
- Batch operations are supported where applicable
- File operations work reliably across different file types and sizes

## Notes

These core file operations are fundamental to the application's functionality. The implementation should be robust, secure, and provide a smooth user experience with appropriate safeguards against accidental data loss.
