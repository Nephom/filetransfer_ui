## Summary

Implement a secure authentication system for the file transfer application. This includes user management, session handling, and integration with the frontend.

## Task Breakdown

### User Authentication
- Implement user registration and login functionality
- Create secure password handling with hashing
- Add session management with JWT tokens or similar
- Implement user role-based access control

### Security Features
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Ensure secure session handling
- Add password reset functionality

### API Integration
- Create authentication middleware for protected routes
- Implement token validation and refresh mechanisms
- Add user profile management endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can register, login, and logout securely
- Passwords are properly hashed and stored
- Sessions are managed securely with appropriate expiration
- Authentication middleware protects protected endpoints
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

## Notes

This authentication system will be critical for securing file transfers and user data. It should follow security best practices and be easily extensible for future authentication methods.
