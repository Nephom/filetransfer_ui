## Summary

Implement real-time progress tracking for file transfers with visual feedback in the UI. This includes backend tracking and frontend display mechanisms.

## Task Breakdown

### Backend Progress Tracking
- Implement file transfer progress monitoring
- Create progress reporting mechanism for long-running operations
- Add real-time status updates to transfer records
- Implement progress persistence for interrupted transfers

### Frontend Display
- Create progress visualization components
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events
- Add progress indicators for individual files and overall transfers
- Include resume functionality for interrupted transfers

### Integration
- Connect backend progress reporting to frontend display
- Ensure smooth real-time updates without excessive polling
- Handle edge cases like connection drops and transfer interruptions
- Add progress logging for debugging purposes

## Acceptance Criteria

- File transfer progress is tracked in real-time
- Frontend displays accurate progress information
- Users can see individual file progress and overall transfer status
- Progress updates are smooth and responsive
- Transfer interruptions can be resumed from where they left off
