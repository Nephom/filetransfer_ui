## Summary

Implement a backend file system abstraction layer that provides a consistent interface for file operations regardless of the underlying storage system. This should include configuration management for different storage backends.

## Task Breakdown

### File System Abstraction Layer
- Create a unified interface for file operations (read, write, delete, list, etc.)
- Implement abstraction for local file system and potential cloud storage backends
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Add support for file metadata operations

### Configuration Management
- Design configuration structure for different storage backends
- Implement configuration loading from environment variables and config files
- Add support for runtime configuration updates
- Create validation for configuration parameters

## Acceptance Criteria

- File system abstraction layer supports multiple storage backends
- Configuration management handles environment variables and config files
- All file operations are properly validated and error-handled
- Configuration is loadable at application startup and supports runtime updates

## Notes

This task is foundational for the file transfer system and will enable future extensions to support different storage backends.
