# Epic: filetransfer_ui

## Overview
This epic outlines the technical implementation of a web-based file management interface that allows users to manage local files and folders through a browser. The system will provide a futuristic UI with drag-and-drop capabilities, comprehensive file operations, and secure authentication.

## Architecture Decisions
- Use Node.js/Express for backend with WebSocket support for real-time progress updates
- React.js frontend with modern UI components for the futuristic design
- Local file system access through backend services with proper security restrictions
- Configuration via config.ini file for port, folder paths, and authentication
- Implement drag-and-drop upload functionality using HTML5 APIs
- Use WebSockets for real-time progress updates during file transfers

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- File browser UI with navigation bar and folder structure visualization
- Drag-and-drop upload area with visual feedback
- File operation controls (rename, move, delete, copy/paste)
- Progress indicators and speed display during transfers
- Authentication/login interface
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile compatibility

### Backend Services
- RESTful API endpoints for file operations
- WebSocket connections for real-time progress updates
- Authentication service with username/password validation
- Configuration manager for reading/writing config.ini
- File system abstraction layer for local operations

### Infrastructure
- Deploy as a single-node application with local file system access
- Use HTTPS for secure transfers
- Implement rate limiting and security measures for file operations
- Monitor system resources during file transfers

## Implementation Strategy
1. Set up project structure with frontend and backend components
2. Implement core file system access and configuration management
3. Develop authentication system with config.ini support
4. Build frontend UI with navigation and file operation controls
5. Add drag-and-drop upload functionality
6. Implement real-time progress tracking and display
7. Test all file operations with various scenarios
