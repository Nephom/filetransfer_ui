# PRD: filetransfer_ui

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for developing a user-friendly file transfer interface that enables users to easily upload, manage, and download files with a clean, intuitive UI. The interface will support multiple file types, provide real-time transfer status updates, and include security features for protected file transfers. It will also enable comprehensive local file system management through a web interface with futuristic design elements.

## Problem Statement
Users currently lack an intuitive interface for managing file transfers, resulting in inefficient workflows and potential errors during file operations. Existing solutions are either too complex for average users or lack essential features like progress tracking, batch operations, and security controls.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to easily upload files to the system so that I can share documents quickly
- As a user, I want to see real-time progress of file transfers so that I can estimate completion time
- As a user, I want to manage multiple files simultaneously through batch operations so that I can handle large transfers efficiently
- As a user, I want to download files with the ability to resume interrupted transfers so that I don't lose progress
- As a user, I want to see file details like size, type, and modification date so that I can easily identify files
- As an admin, I want to manage file access permissions and track transfer history so that I can maintain security
- As a user, I want to manage local files and folders through the web interface including upload, download (with zip compression for multiple files), rename (with warning for multiple files), move, delete (with confirmation), copy and paste
- As a user, I want a futuristic-looking web interface with matching color scheme
- As a user, I want a navigation bar corresponding to the web interface
- As a user, I want to upload files or folders via drag-and-drop
- As a user, I want the application to have a config.ini file that can write service port, local folder path to manage, and default username/password for authentication
- As a user, I want progress bars and speed display during file transfers
- As a user, I want to navigate back to the previous folder structure

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- File upload interface with drag-and-drop support
- File download functionality with resume capability
- Batch operations for multiple files
- File browser with sorting and filtering options
- Progress indicators for active transfers
- File preview capabilities for common document types
- User authentication and authorization system
- Transfer history tracking with timestamps
- File type validation and size limits
- Local file management capabilities (upload, download, rename, move, delete, copy/paste)
- Configurable settings via config.ini file
- Navigation bar for interface structure
- Folder navigation with back functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Transfers should complete within 5 seconds of initiating
- Security: All file transfers must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols
- Scalability: System should handle 1000 concurrent transfers without degradation
- Usability: Interface must be accessible and intuitive for all user levels
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime with automatic retry mechanisms for failed transfers
- Compatibility: Support all modern browsers and mobile devices
- Visual Design: Futuristic aesthetic with consistent color scheme

## Success Criteria
- 90% user satisfaction rate in usability testing
- Average transfer time under 30 seconds for files under 100MB
- 99.9% transfer success rate over a 30-day period
- Zero security incidents in production environment
- 5-star rating in app store reviews
- Successful implementation of all local file management features

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Development will follow existing company design guidelines
- Integration with existing authentication and storage systems
- Limited bandwidth for transfers in low-bandwidth environments
- All users will have modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- No external dependencies beyond standard web technologies
- Local file system access will be available to the application

## Out of Scope
- Direct file sharing between users (peer-to-peer)
- File versioning and collaboration features
- Advanced compression algorithms for file optimization
- Integration with third-party cloud storage services
- Mobile app development (web-based interface only)

## Dependencies
- Authentication system integration
- File storage backend services
- Network infrastructure with sufficient bandwidth
- SSL/TLS certificates for secure transfers
- CDN for optimized file delivery
- Local file system access permissions
